# Calculator v0.2

My first windows app that I use to learn C#, visual studio and what GitHub is all about. 

Coming over from javascript, php and other web development languages written in notepad++, got to say: the above three are all very impressive.

Anyway, some details about this calculator:
- console app
- supports brackets and all basic operators
- supports single letter variables that can be used in calculations (work in progress)
- variables can be described with a comment as a reminder what they hold (work in progress)
- type 'help' to show all the available commands

More to come.
