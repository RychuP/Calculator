# Calculator v0.5

My first windows app written to learn C#, visual studio and what GitHub is all about. 

Coming over from javascript, php and other web development languages written in notepad++, got to say I am very impressed so far.
    
Anyway, some details about this calculator:
- console app
- expressions can be grouped in brackets
- implemented operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division and exponantiation
- division by zero is disallowed and so are operations that result in infinity or NaN
- single letter variables store results and can be used in further calculations
- variables can be described with comments as a reminder of what they hold
- type 'help' to show all the available commands
